  <h1>The Question </h1>
  How can technology help consumers learn about the soil and water management and production
  practices used to product the flowers and plants they purchase?

  <h1>Background</h2>
    Niagara is home to over 500 acres of greenhouses; much of that in floriculture (flower)
    & nursery production valued at over $300 million per year. At a provincial level, Ontario
    exports $275 million and imports another $260 million of flowers and nursery products every year.
    Flowers are beautiful, but most consumers don't know what happens inside a greenhouse, or whether the plants
    they buy were grown sustainably. In recent years, water quality from greenhouses has become an increasing concern.
    The incoming qater quality needs to be good, with no contaminants that could harm the plants. At the same time, excess/unused
    fertilizer can build up in the water. Some greenhouses have come under scrutiny for fertilizer-containing water being
    discharged into the natural environment. Many greenhouses have started recycling their water and using additional water
    treatment to remove leftover fertilizer. Educating consumers about growing practices and highlighting sustainably-grown Products
    may help encourage greenhouse growers to continue innovating and adopting better practices. How can technology provide some solutions here?

    <h2>Takeaway</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>The challenge isn't how to make water recycling system.</li>
     <li>We need to focus on educating the consumer above all else to make informed decisions about where their plants come from.</li>
     <li></li>
   </ul>



  <h2>The Approach </h2>
  We need a simple way to inform the consumers about where plants come from. Following from how grocery stores sort produce based
  on organic or non-organic certified vegetables. If we can come up with a certification for those greenhouses that is plainly visible
  to the consumer like the organic and non-organic produce. On the certified plants we will use a QR code to inform the user about the plant they have
  purchased and where it came from.
